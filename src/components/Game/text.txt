    Someone asked me what I wished for and I
    <button className="link-minimal" onClick={handleNext}>
      said
    </button>
    ...
  </p>,
  <p className="game-text game-text__second">
    I wished for {name}'s{" "}
    <button className="link-minimal" onClick={handleNext}>
      happiness
    </button>{" "}
    because {name} deserves it.
  </p>,
  <p className="game-text game-text__third">
    And then I wished for {name}'s safety because {name} deserves that too.{" "}
    <br />
    <br />
    It had been awhile but I saw {name} the other day. I was so glad to see them
    because if they're here then I know they're still there and trying.
    <br />
    <br />
    It means that {name} is safe.
    <button className="link-minimal" onClick={handleNext}>
      What more could anyone ask for?
    </button>
  </p>,
  <p className="game-text game-text__fourth">
    Actually, that's not true. I feel like I'm always asking for more. I think
    when you get around
    <br />
    to caring about someone, them being okay
    <br />
    just isn't enough anymore.
    <br />
    <br />
    You always want more for them.
    <br />
    <br />
    So I wished for {name}'s health because a deserves that too.
    <br />
    <br />I hope they're taking care. I've never seen brighter eyes.
    <br />
    Don't you think they've got places to go?
    <br />
    Someone to become? That starts with the fundamentals, right?
    <br />
    <br />
    <button className="link-minimal" onClick={handleNext}>
      Right.
    </button>
  </p>,
  <p className="game-text game-text__fifth">
    And space.
    <br />
    <br />
    Don't you think that space is always overlooked?
    <br />
    We're so worried about people being alone but it's really the loneliness
    that does the damage. So you just have to reassure the people you love and
    let them do their thing. I think {name} deserves time for themselves
    sometimes too, you know? To reflect, recharge, and then come back around
    whenever they feel better.
    <br />
    <br />
    I'm always so happy when {name} comes around. I think I'll always be there
    to greet them; even if it's in passing, I'd love to hear from them.
    <br />
    <br />
    So yeah, I always wish for {name}'s
    {/* we have to add the following line because otherwise there will be an annoying extra space before 'space' */}
    {/* prettier-ignore */}
    <button className="link-minimal" onClick={handleNext}>space</button>
    <br />
    because {name} deserves it.
  </p>,
  <p className="game-text game-text__sixth">
    And peace of mind—I always wish for {name}'s peace of mind.
    <br />
    Whatever they're up to, I hope things work out for {name}.<br />
    Nothing is ever really easy but you just have to meet {name} to know.
    They're so good and trying—why wouldn't things work out for them?
    <br />I hope they realize that too.
    <br />
    <br />
    And because {name} deserves it.
    <br />
    <br />
    <button className="link-minimal" onClick={handleNext}>
      What makes someone deserving of something
    </button>
    ?
  </p>,
  <p className="game-text game-text__seventh">
    That's a good question. I feel like we all have our own idea of what
    "deserving" looks like. To me, it looks a lot like {name}. Do you think
    that—
    <br />
    <br />
    <button className="link-minimal" onClick={handleNext}>
      I think you should tell them this.
    </button>
  </p>,

    You're right. I think a should hear this from me. So.
